        <h1>How to play Texas Hold'em Poker</h1>

        <h2>Objective of the Game</h2>
        <p>The goal of Texas Hold'em is to make the best five-card hand possible using any combination of your two hole cards and the five community cards on the table.</p>

        <h2>The Basics</h2>
        <p>Texas Hold'em is typically played with 2 to 10 players. The game consists of four betting rounds: Pre-flop, Flop, Turn, and River. At each round, players have the option to bet, check, raise, or fold.</p>

        <h3>1. The Deal</h3>
        <p>Each player is dealt two private cards (also called hole cards). These cards are only visible to the player who receives them.</p>

        <h3>2. The Betting Rounds</h3>
        <p>There are four rounds of betting in Texas Hold'em:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pre-flop:</strong> After each player has been dealt two hole cards, the first round of betting begins. Players can call, raise, or fold.</li>
            <li><strong>Flop:</strong> The dealer deals three community cards face-up in the center of the table. Another round of betting takes place.</li>
            <li><strong>Turn:</strong> A fourth community card is dealt face-up. A third round of betting follows.</li>
            <li><strong>River:</strong> The fifth and final community card is dealt. The final round of betting takes place.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. The Showdown</h3>
        <p>After the final round of betting, any remaining players reveal their hole cards. The player with the best five-card hand wins the pot. If two or more players have the same hand, the pot is split equally between them.</p>

        <h2>Hand Rankings</h2>
        <p>The following are the hand rankings from highest to lowest:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Royal Flush:</strong> A, K, Q, J, 10, all the same suit.</li>
            <li><strong>Straight Flush:</strong> Five consecutive cards of the same suit.</li>
            <li><strong>Four of a Kind:</strong> Four cards of the same rank.</li>
            <li><strong>Full House:</strong> Three of a kind and a pair.</li>
            <li><strong>Flush:</strong> Five cards of the same suit, not in sequence.</li>
            <li><strong>Straight:</strong> Five consecutive cards of any suit.</li>
            <li><strong>Three of a Kind:</strong> Three cards of the same rank.</li>
            <li><strong>Two Pair:</strong> Two different pairs of cards.</li>
            <li><strong>One Pair:</strong> Two cards of the same rank.</li>
            <li><strong>High Card:</strong> When no hand is made, the highest card wins.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Betting Actions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Check:</strong> When you don't want to bet, but you want to stay in the game. Only available if no one has bet in the current round.</li>
            <li><strong>Call:</strong> To match the current bet made by another player.</li>
            <li><strong>Raise:</strong> To increase the current bet.</li>
            <li><strong>Fold:</strong> To give up your hand and all your chips in the current round.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Tips for Beginners</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Pay attention to your position at the table — being in a later position can give you an advantage in decision-making.</li>
            <li>Start with conservative bets and don't overextend yourself early in the game.</li>
            <li>Keep track of the community cards and think about how they might help or hurt your hand.</li>
            <li>Know when to fold — sometimes it's better to cut your losses rather than chase a weak hand.</li>
        </ul>
